						"handsome Elf male in a white robe takes pause in the middle of a battle to survey the scene before him. Seeing a nearby footman losing ground to a bloodlusting Orc, he touches the corpse of a nearby Worg, which rises from the afterlife and lunges at the green beast",
						"A Tiefling in black leather armor raises her sword to parry the wild swing of a cackling Gnoll. As her free hand grabs the creature’s unarmored wrist, it lets out a yelp as a green misty substance flows into the Tiefling’s palm and out of a cut on her forearm - a cut that slowly starts to close.",
						"Seeing an Ogre’s giant club about to come down on him, a tired warrior closes his eyes and awaits death. A howl sounds, and the fighter opens his eyes: he sees the giant flailing around wildly, grasping its face. Standing behind it is a mischievous Gnome, grinning through his beard, holding an open tome.",

								"If there is one credo that rings true for even the most powerful, it is that all mortals must die - whether sooner or later. These sinister figures, however, prefer later over sooner: necromancers are those who have somehow learned to manipulate the essence of life itself. Through their techniques, they take it from those they deem undeserving, control it to their own liking, and sometimes even give it to those who could further their efforts. Most necromancers live their life in pursuit of immortality, whether for themselves or a loved one. Though they live by the credo of inescapable mortality, the ultimate goal that their skills are a means towards is often to beat that exact clock they know so well ticks for everyone."

								"Contrary to popular belief, necromancers are not necessarily evil-doers, nor do all of them seek to subjugate others. In fact, some of them seek to use their powers for good: a poor understanding of their skills as well as their use of frightening undead monstrosities has simply led to a more generalized fear of their capacities. In reality, necromancers are a varied set of people. There is, however, one thing all of them have in common: each necromancer has some form of power over the vital essences that move any living creature - and they seek to use this to their advantage. Whether strayed wizards, aspiring acolytes or even blessed priests of gods of life, necromancers aim to achieve their goals by manipulating the very core of any creature's being."

								"In creating a necromancer, there is one important fact to consider: ‘how did you come into contact with necromancy, and why do you use it?'. Were you a young wizard who discovered their talent for manipulating life essence was more effective than blasting enemies with evocation spells? Did you grow up in a demon-worshipping cult that required the storing of life essence for satanic rituals? Or perhaps the source of your talent is unknown and mysterious? And what is the appeal of Necromancy to your character? Is it simply 'power over others', or did you perhaps lose a loved one to disease and felt the inability to prevent their death frustrating?",

Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at spell casting and plan to take up the Creed of Tomes archetype. Choose Constitution instead if you plan to emphasize either the summoning of undead minions or the manipulation of health pools. Second, choose the Acolyte or Sage background. Third, choose the Chill Touch and Thaumaturgy cantrips."
